## In this project i was implemented the sql database for **orders** ##

## npm start to run the server

## If the database is not present
    http://localhost:3004/createDb --> to create database

## for creating tables
    http://localhost:3004/createTable --> to create table

## for Inserting data
    http://localhost:3004/insertdata -->  to insert data into table

## for getting the latest 7 orders 
    http://localhost:3004/latestOreders --> to get the latest 7 orders ( this calls the function that written for the latest orders and consolelogs the data)
    # ordersDatabasenodesql
